# Memory game (Frozen 2)

Memory game created in vanilla Javascript.

Objective was to practice vanillae javascript and logical thinking. 

This card-flip memory game was created purely for practice and not to showcase ability.  It was created utilising a partially coded tutorial found online and with a view to assist in my development, js language practice and logical thinking.
